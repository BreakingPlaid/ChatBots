       "\"okay so I this talk is dreams and genocide : Yemen it is actually part 4 of a series that we started last year what happened was the Austin school the student club asked me to do a series on the Middle East and we ended up picking four States actually technically it was five but we jettisoned one of them we had four states Egypt Iran Iraq and then Syria and then last semester when I got to the Syria talk I couldn't do it and it's because I have a vicarious trauma apparently this is a real condition for people who study who are in academia who study this stuff from a distance and you know all we're doing is reading accounts and then looking at pictures and video and apparently your body reacts very similarly to if you were actually in the same situation and I just got to the point where I couldn't do Syria I had actually done multiple talks on Syria so it really would have just been an update talk as opposed to a new talk and so I jettison that talk and then I decided to do Yemen so I'll probably still do this area talk but next semester as my as my as I paste the trauma I expose myself to anyway hopefully you guys will pick a better profession than mine I'm thinking art historian in my next life or something like that or physicist maybe I can design mix for a living that sounds like it would be less traumatic than then political science with an eye towards international relations so having said that all of these talks are intended to be essentially standalone so there's probably if you've seen my talk my previous talks there's probably gonna be a little bit of overlap a little bit of redundancy because I want to make sure that the foundation is there and then I'm gonna focus strongly on Yemen so to start the talk what I want to do is start with 1919 and the reason because 1919 a hundred years ago this year there was a really important event that took place in Egypt that actually framed much of what ends up happening in the Middle East over the course of the next hundred years and that event is a revolution Egypt went into a state of revolution in 1880 the British took advantage of Egypt the chaos that Egypt was in in in the 1880 revolution and invaded Egypt in 1882 and conquered it and annexed it to the British Empire and 37 years later Egypt goes into a second revolution this time it's explicitly to try to get the British out and what the Egyptians did was they knew that they couldn't do it alone that Egypt versus Britain there was no way Britain could be defeated and so they began talking to the Irish and the Indians who also wanted independence from the British Empire and India Ireland in Egypt one into rebellion at the same time in fact as legend has it and I all stuff is some level a little bit legendary it's why India and Ireland's flags are the same right one is vertical one is horizontal but the colors are the same they're green why orange because in the case of India it was supposed to be green for Islam orange for Hinduism in case of Ireland it was Green for Catholicism orange for Protestantism so they were showing that there were multi religious states going forward and they were part of the same movement which was to break away from the British Empire what ended up happening was sort of a mixed bag Gandhi decided that the Indian Revolution was too violent and he didn't want India to break away from the British Empire violently and so he went on a hunger strike and he basically forced the revolutionaries to choose between Gandhi dying or their independence and they chose they didn't want Gandhi to die and so they quit the revolution and as a result it'll take another quarter century for India to get its independence from the British Empire Egypt and Ireland on the other hand had success they pulled this off but when dealing with the British Empire you never ever fully pull it off right so when the United States got us into penance part of the British surrender treaty at the Treaty of Paris was that we would become a vassal state of the British Empire we didn't get true independence we pretend we're really good at lies and lying to ourselves but economically we would remain essentially a part of the British Empire when it came to foreign policy we had limits put on us so we were not fully truly independent the same of course happens for for Ireland Egypt and even India when it finally does get independence because the British partition it right in this one last-ditch effort to hurt India they break it up in the case of Ireland they they they partition it too they take most of Ulster away and make northern Northern Ireland and that province remains in the United Kingdom when the rest of Ireland gets its independence in the case of Egypt they do the same thing they go okay you want you want more autonomy you want more independence that's cool but we're gonna maintain a permanent military presence and we're gonna keep this - as canal you don't get to completely go independent and of course you're gonna compromise because if you're Ireland or you're Egypt you know the only way to get full independence would might be decades more of fighting and so you just sort of okay good enough or close enough the reason that the 1919 revolution matters so much though is because it created or at least Illustrated the directions in which the Arab world was about to go down or at least attempt to go down to make the revolution successful it wasn't enough to just want the British gone or at least partially gone Egyptians needed to create an ideology that motivated people to go into the streets and be willing to die to fight the British independence wasn't enough they needed something else and a group of Christian Egyptians the Coptic Orthodox Church is the Christian Church in a in Egypt a group of Coptic Egyptians actually ended up creating the dominant ideology for the 1919 revolution and that revolutions ideology was pan-arab secular socialism the idea the pan-arab part is that everything from Morocco to should be unified into a single Arab state the secular part was that it would not be religiously motivated and it would be tolerant towards the minority religions that existed within that male Republic and then the socialism was socialism not communism but socialism as in something resembling what Sweden is the pan-arab secular socialists dominated the revolution and as a result they planted the seed for its eventual future successes having said that then there's a reaction against it so the the pan-arab secular socialism becomes the dominant ideology in Egypt so two new ideologies pop up to push back against those two that in that new ideology one of them is what we now call the faloona the faloona are actually a group of egyptians they're not truly an ideology because they don't have a coherent set of beliefs they just sort of change their beliefs as necessary they're not necessarily secular they don't they don't really care about separation between mosque and state but at the same time they don't mind it either like they're not attached to having a religion mix with the states but they're not attached to having a secular state either when it's convenient they bring up religion when it's not convenient they reject religion what they are is they are capitalist now what they've concluded with the fluo believe is that Egyptians are inherently by their nature socialists that is to say that Egyptians have a strong community tie to each other that they think of their neighbors and their family members first and then they think about themselves and their own greedy ambitions last so will the flow believe that's terrible that if you're gonna modernize what you need to do is create the liberal model of capitalism where everybody is sort of dog-eat-dog rational self-interest always motivated bought yourself and your own economic interests you never care about anybody else so what the fleu believe is the only way to achieve that in Egypt is to create tyranny and then shove this down the throat of their population that you have to break Arab culture and you have to make them arrows more like Americans where you know it's just isolated little bubbles where you don't have contact with each other you don't have strong family ties you kind of hate your family and you'd rather just binge watch Netflix and shopping malls and never actually have human experiences right that's their model that's what they think would be a utopia the third group were the Islamists and they were of course encapsulated in Egypt by the Muslim Brotherhood the idea there was that they didn't care whether it was Arab or not Arab what they wanted was Muslim so everything from Morocco to Indonesia should be unified into a single state if you got to that but they didn't really care that wasn't really a motive of theirs the real motive was that in every Muslim state the laws should reflect the religion and there should be no separation between mosque and state so that so 1919 is this breakout moment for the Middle East because it creates the three dominant ideologies having said that there's a there's another vector so there's there's that plane but then there's another vector and it's also three and it's what type of political system should you have should you be a democracy should you be a monarchy should you be a republic and by Republic I it's a euphemism for a benevolent tyranny in other words do you need to have a heavy-handed ruler who will transition your state like the fool believe you need a heavy-handed ruler who will transition the state into a capitalist system or do you do you want to open it up to the public or do you want to just have a monarchy be in charge and at the point where Egypt gets its assent essentially its autonomy in 1920 in the aftermath of 1919 revolution it's a monarchy it has a king and so the assumption is is that Egypt will kind of go down a fool' path with this monarch at the head even though the dominant people in the revolution or these pan-arab secular socialists who don't want that what they wanted to do is create a republic not-not-not have a monarchy but that's the path they're on this is sort of the British compromise and so that's that's the background for Egypt's role in this what it does though is it inspires other Arab states and one of those other Arab states really it's a country at this point because it's actually divided into two pieces is Yemen so North Yemen had broken away broke away from the Ottoman Empire about a hundred and fifty years ago and became a kingdom the chunk of land that's North Yemen so if you think of the Arabian Peninsula it's the south west corner that's Yemm and North emn is the northern piece of it it's where the bulk of the Yemenis population lives so it's probably about 80 85 percent of the Yemenis population lives in North Yemen it's it's extremely mountainous there's two relatively big cities there tyese and some off so not it was the obvious location for a capital but they actually did do a dual capital for a while and then they were South Yemen South Yemen is mostly desert it does green up during the monsoons there's one big city I didn't and that's about it South Yemen got captured by the British Empire and was actually attached to India even though geographically it's it's clearly not India they made it politically part of it part of India so they sort of ruled it together with the rest of that part of the Empire and the reason was is because they saw as the point so Yemen is where bab-el-mandeb is so if you think of the Red Sea the very top is the Suez Canal and Egypt the very bottom is Djibouti and Yemen the way the British saw it was by controlling I didn't they were making sure that ships could flow through bab-el-mandeb on their way to India so that's one of the reasons why they just attached it to India even though culturally and geographically had nothing to do with in you they're people they're they're brown people lump them together no big deal the British Empire they can do whatever they want what ends up happening is the British know the writing's on the wall the Empire is starting to come up seems there's a matter of time before they're gonna lose South Yemen while that's taking place pan-arab secular socialism gets this huge victory 1952 Egypt does another revolution so in 72 years Egypt has three revolutions alright we're talking about a seriously revolutionary population they just can't get enough of revolution in the middle of the revolution the army a part of the army is very heavily interested in pan-arab secular socialism that part of the army includes four Colonels from the Sudan so just a really weird thing Egypt invades and conquers the Sudan then Egypt gets conquered by the British Empire and then the British Empire goes oh we really want to exploit the resources of the Sudan but we want you Egyptians to keep running it as if it was part of Egypt so Egypt basically was stuck doing Britain's dirty work in the Sudan and the British actually named it anglo-egyptian Sudan to show that it was a joint a jointly held operation so so as Egypt gets its independence its nominal independence into 1920 it ends up in still still with ownership of the Sudan so Egyptian soldiers would be stationed in the Sudan four of them became friends they got part of this pan-arab secular socialism in 1952 they end up in charge of the army coup d'etat so the army actually does a coup on the on the monarchy and overthrows the king of Egypt when that happens a guy named Gamal up the law sir more or less ends up in charge of Egypt he's not officially the president there's a guy named Mohammad Najib who's the president the irony of Mohammad Najib being the president was used half sudanese so in 1952 egypt became the first white country on earth to have a black president i know you wanted to be the united states sorry to beat you twice egypt does two black presidents 1970s Sadat becomes president of Egypt so he dismissed it next oh I know you can do first woman oh no we can't cuz like everybody's had a woman now so oh we could be the last country on earth to have a woman president there that's cool that's something to brag about don't you think that's yeah some of you don't seem to be on board anyway so what happens is Mohammed Najib is literally the the CIA walks into his office with with suitcases of money and Nasser the the colonel he wasn't even a general who was basically in charge of the of the coup that overthrew the monarchy just simply disappears Mohammed Najib takes the money and then he has a constitutional convention holds elections and in 1956 he becomes president of Egypt and they bring in a new constitution that Constitution is a pan-arab secular socialist Constitution it sets it up so that Nasser is going to be the tyrant so right it's not a democracy it's not a monarchy it's gonna be a tyrant but benevolent tyrant like if if the United States gave up its democracy tomorrow which it basically has anyway and we ended up with Nasser as its as our president we'd be ok it's not the worst thing that ever happened to a people there is such a thing as benevolent tyrants and Nasser was definitely that having said that he's also crazy ambitious because he really likes this pan Arab peace he really does want everything from Morocco to Iraq to get you know Floyd in 1958 two things happen that are basically earthquakes for Egypt one Sudan comes and goes we're done we don't want to be part of Egypt anymore we're going our own way we don't care about your pan Arab dreams we're sick of your tyranny Egypt we're out of here and also guys okay and they break away it's a it's just that's it that same year though the exact it happens Syria the Syrian state was on the brink of collapse the reason why Syria was in so much trouble is when it got its independence from France after World War two it got its independence as a democracy it's one of the few Arab states to start off as a democracy most of them get their independence from European states as a monarchy or a tyranny here's Syria with its its vibrant brand-new shiny democracy everything's looking great 1946 world is new alive Syria is rich and then we overthrow the democracy in 1949 the CIA goes in does a coup Punk's them and it's plunges Syria into a nightmare hell chaos for the next nine years serious cycles through eleven different leaders there is a coup and then there's a coup against the coup and then there's a coup it's madness the Syrian state basically is on the verge of collapse ironically enough I'll co-op the guy who got coud the first president first elected president 46 the guy who got coup d'etat by the CIA in 1949 ends up back in charge of Syria he manages to get into the position of president and takes over he then sends Nasser a message he goes look serious done we're our state is about to collapse we're about to become a failed state but worse yet there's a high probability that the Communists are gonna prevail in the chaos that follows and they're gonna take over in Syria I desperately hate the Communists I want nothing to do with them I'm a socialist I'm a pan-arab secular socialist at heart I think this is the way forward not communism you've got to save us Nasser is like yeah of course what can I do what can I do and I'll coop they goes annex Syria and exit right now lawsuit goes wait a minute he goes yeah we're dot let's do it you want to do a pan-arab secular state right now Syria in Egypt where I'm gonna I'm the president Syria I'm gonna sign Syria over to you you're gonna become the president of Syria and Oscar goes we're not ready we don't have the infrastructure we don't have the political sense I've been running Egypt for for six years now I don't have any experience nobody knows what they're doing we're still figuring this out we just got out from underneath the the British Empire I just I'm letting Sudan go its own way you want us to annex you and I'll quote Lee goes you have a choice I'm putting in to you you are an excess or we go communist and Nasser hated the Communist anyway all right annexation it is the two presidents sitting next to each other they sign over a treaty Egypt and Syria merge they officially lose the name Egypt in Syria and they become United Arab Republic Cairo is the capital and I our Republic gobble up the law sir is the president United Arab Republic it's done this truly inspires the same year 1958 Iraq goes into revolution it it was conquered by the British in 1920 they they stall the monarchy King Faisal the first and then King Faisal the second Faisal the second is killed in the revolution in 1958 and Iraq is the Iraqi parliament is taken over by the pan-arab secular socialists they immediately want to merge Iraq with Syria in Egypt and create a single state if you look at Syria Egypt and Iraq flag it's all red white black red stripe white stripe black stripe because this is what they wanted to do is merge into a single pan Arab secular state having said that the United States knew that that's what the pan Arab secular socialist wanted to do in Iraq so what they did was what we did was we interrupted it by funding the Communists that was our strategy in the Middle East that wherever we could no matter what no matter whom we hurt we would always go and side with the other guy against the pan-arab secular socialist so in Egypt we funded the Muslim Brotherhood in Iraq we funded the Communists the Soviet Union and I sent money to the same people in Iraq and what we did was we made it so that the executive branch of the new Iraqi government the new Iraqi democracy that emerges from the revolution the 1958 revolution we made it so that that part was actually communist and because they were the executive branch they didn't then asked to join don't worry the guy we got into power we killed him five years later in a CIA assassination so right it's it all worked out in the end oh and if the United States ever offers to help you and you're a revolutionary never take the help you will be killed later so just lessons learned the reason all of this matters for Yemen is Yemen catches the fever in 1962 in the kingdom of Yemen which is North Yemen the Yemenis decide they want to go down the same path and they overthrow their monarchy so they view a repeat of the 1958 overthrow in Iraq the kingdom of Yemen now becomes the Republic of Yemen and then they they're immediately in trouble and the reason is is because the monarchist take to the field and begin a civil war they're not they don't accept the overthrow of the monarchy Saudi Arabia Israel in the United States began pumping supplies weapons money special forces into North Yemen on the side of the monarchists fighting the guys who are the who are trying to create a republic a pan-arab secular socialist republic in yemen so just to make sure we're clear today there's a civil war in Yemen and the United States Israel and Saudi Arabia are again on the same exact side in the contemporary of any civil war as they were in 1962 the newly established president of North Yemen realizes he doesn't have the ability to fight the United States is in Saudi Arabia on his own and so he he goes to Egypt he says we desperately need your help just add a twist to the whole thing the previous year in 1961 Syria felt abused by Egypt and Syria was master really messed that up and Syria broke away so the United Arab Republic lasted it whole of three years in nineteen so the next year 1962 Yemen invites Egypt doing - to jump in decide with the secular socialist rebels against the monarchies Nasser sends the Egyptian military now historians will say this was Egypt's Vietnam since the Tonkin Gulf Resolution didn't happen till 65 it's historically more accurate to say that Vietnam was the United States as Yemen because Egypt does Yemen in 62 beat it beat the United States by three years but I guess the United States had been sending soldiers to Vietnam for by by 62 for probably about three or four years so I you know it's whatever there is a huge difference though and that is that the United States aside was defeated in in Vietnam where as in the case of Yemen the Egypt side actually prevails but in the sense that you don't know who the enemy is it's a guerrilla war it's village to village fighting it's complete chaos there's no front line and it's a terrible drain on the economy and the country that's fighting in this case Egypt in the United States as the outsider feels demoralized then yeah yeah my name is Egypt Vietnam it is a disaster the Egyptian military doesn't know who shoot they don't know where the front line is and it's just eight years of this which is interesting because if but according to United States government we did Vietnam for eight years right 65 to 70 three-quarter United States Army it's 61 to 75 but who cares the army the government who's going to be more honest always more honest it's a sad sad right geez how do we get here we've always been here that's the thing it's just did always we're look at it was like how did I get here know dude you've always been there you didn't get anywhere nothing's changed it's always been like this you just not good at paying attention to your surroundings you just notice now that you're here that's all in any case Egypt goes in and it's this nightmare mass it's insane the United States under a be in Israel putting everything you got into the monarchist and then the next year 63 South Yemen breaks away from the British Empire South Yemen at first doesn't know what direction to take eventually it goes communist South Yemen is the only Arab state to ever draw communist the South Vietnamese government renames themselves the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen they immediately establish links with the Soviet Union the Soviet Union starts pumping money into Southie Amanda profit up because it's going to be this grand Communist experiment in the Arab world and that's kind of okay I guess to make a long story short the civil war in Yemen ends up ending because of basically Israel attacking Egypt in 1967 Israel attacks Egypt Egypt had three-quarters of its military assets in Yemen and in six days Israel defeats Egypt mostly because you just didn't have any military assets to fight with Egypt was caught with his pants down around its ankle in the days leading up to the 1967 six-day war Nasser was trying to negotiate out a way to prevent the war and he had actually contacted LBJ and said look I think the Israelis are going to attack me I need to start pulling assets up from Yemen if that's the case can you assure me that they're not going to attack and LBJ said I swear Israel isn't going to attack you you're fine don't worry about it and so Nasser doesn't pull up assets cuz he believed the president I states that's dumb and of course the Israelis Punk Egypt Syria and Jordan and this humiliating catastrophic rout Egypt had at 222 plain air force and the whole thing was caught on the ground and then I elated before a single plane got in the air it's just just a catastrophe at that point Egypt no longer interested in fighting the Yemeni Civil War it just doesn't know how to extract itself and so the war lingers for another three years finally in 1970 kind of on a whim saturated says hey Egypt you want to come to eat to Saudi Arabia and negotiate out a deal an end deal and Austin's like I am there whatever we could do to get out of this disaster they go they meet and within it a couple of days they sign a deal and the deal ends the Civil War it allows Yemen through referendum to choose whether it's going to become a monarchy or remain a republic the Yemenis people vote they vote for Republic so the Egyptian side wins the Saudi Israeli US side loses in a popular vote and Yemen becomes a republic well it had been since 62 North Yemen anyway so fast forward just a little bit well before we fast words in 1972 North and South Yemen or the South Yemen immediately began talking about unification in 70 once the civil war was over North and South Yemen go okay let's let's talk about unifying two years later they attack each other they have a little border dispute they fight a little war over the border it gets resolved they quit fighting each other doesn't last this battle between north and south Ian doesn't last the border dispute isn't fully resolved but it's resolved good enough that they can move on in 1978 ali abdullah saleh becomes the president of north yemen he is on paper the a pan-arab secular socialist that's it that's the stalk the ideological stalk he's from there's another guy like him who becomes the president of Iraq same time and his name is Saddam Hussein he also on paper is a pan-arab secular socialist but in reason I'm saying on paper is because in reality the only thing they care about is their own power and ruling there on their own state in other words yeah they would love to do this grand scheme that that makes for liberty and improves the quality of life for the entire Arab world but in but they've sort of given up and one of the reasons is because of what happens in the 1973 arab-israeli war so Egypt attacks Israel for the first time this is the first time an Arab state attacked Israel up until then Israel was always the aggressor in 1973 and the reason why a [\\xa0__\\xa0] does finally attack Israel is because they wanted the Sinai back Israel captured the Sinai in the six-day war and it's a catastrophe for Egypt in part because most of its natural gas and all of its oil was in the Sinai so it immediately cut off Egypt an oil poor natural gas poor state from its its energy resources another reason why they want the Sinai back so desperately is as long as the Israeli military's on one side of the Suez Canal and the Egyptian military is on the other side of the Suez Canal it's shut down the Israelis actually sank ships and the Suez Canal to prevent any traffic from going through as long as no traffic is going through Egypt isn't getting that revenue because all the ships that go through have to pay Egypt for passage and so without that revenue it's actually stifling Egypt's economy so Egypt has to attack Israel to get that territory back because it's a matter of life and death economically and they do during the war Egypt basically destroys the Israeli Sinai military in two days it's a catastrophe for the Israelis it's it's a repeat of the 67 war except it's the reverse it's the Israelis getting punked this time Kissinger calls up Israel says hey I'm here for you we're gonna we're gonna be there side-by-side during your surrender negotiations as you give up the cyanide Egypt Israel went absolutely not under no circumstances will we ever negotiate from a position of weakness if you want us to negotiate you have to you have to help us militarily first so we literally fly every tank that we have available we spray off we used to put white stars on a tank we spray them off the Israelis put on a triangle and we fly these tanks to Israel and we immediately rearm Israel with tank army the Israelis jump in the tanks Kissinger calls Imam and goes alright now you're in a position of strength let's negotiate Israel goes no no we have to Punk Egypt first we can't be we can't have been losing the war and be in a position of strength we have to be winning the war and so they counter-attack they cut the Egyptian Sinai army in half they cross the Suez Canal and they're charging into Egypt proper the Soviet Union calls the United States hey just want you to know Israeli army is getting way too close close to Damascus and way too close to Cairo if they go any further if the Israelis cross the hundred kilometer mark inside Egypt proper on the west side of the Suez Canal we're going in and this they had a they had a line for Damascus as well we're going in Kissinger calls up Israel hey gotta tell you it's really sad but the Soviets have told us they're gonna go in you should know we're not coming in after them this is just gonna be you against the Soviet Union probably not gonna work out real well for you but we're not gonna start World War 3 over this you should have surrendered you tricked me and now I've given you this army and now you're using it in a way I didn't mean for you to use and now you're about to start World War three we're not going to do this you're on your own so the Israelis when they got to the hundred kilometer mark they they brought a road cutter with them you know you've seen them they got the big wheel alright and they cut a strip of highway out of the the road at the hundred kilometer mark and took it back to a museum in Israel to show that they had been in in a hundred kilometers and then they stopped just as the Soviet paratroopers were loading into the airplanes the Israeli stopped Kissinger goes all right now let's negotiate so these guys go yep we're ready it's good so Kissinger then flies to Syria he goes to President Hafez al-assad the father of the current Syrian tyrant he goes to put Hafez al-assad and he says look I want to make a comprehensive peace deal I want to make it so there's never another arab-israeli war I want to make it so that the Middle East becomes the stable beacon of hope for the whole planet what I want to do is I want to make a comprehensive deal that includes Israel the Palestinians Egypt Jordan and Syria Lebanon everybody we're gonna get everybody a table we're gonna sit them down and we're gonna make some kind of deal that sets up the Palestinians so that they're not stateless people stuck in refugee camps for all eternity we're gonna do something that makes the Israelis feel secure we're gonna get you the Golan Heights back we're gonna get Egypt the Sinai back we're gonna figure out what what Jordan's water rights are to the Jordan River all of this whole thing and Havas Allah says like wow are you gonna do this for real this is incredible I'm on board I will support the United States any way I can this is remarkable Kissinger is like thank you so much jumps on an airplane flies to Egypt so that's he's Kissinger sits down with Sadat and says so I I've been talking to everybody I talked to the Palestinians and talked to the Israelis I talked to the Syrians I talked to Jordanians I got to tell you it it's great it's grim the Syrians don't want to cooperate the Jordanians don't want to cooperate this is the Palestinians don't want to cooperate look the only way forward is Bannen everybody and make a separate peace deal with the Israelis just just Egypt in Israel because nobody else is gonna work with you they're all only thinking about themselves they're gonna backstab you it's it's bad in this amazing this is US diplomacy at its finest so not goes okay I guess what am I gonna do I can't fight the United States I had to fight the United States military we were defeated we beat the Israeli military took us two days but who can fight the United States I'm gonna surrender I'm gonna make a separate peace deal Hafez al-assad here's what Kissinger is done that Egypt's gonna make a separate peace deal he freaks out he feels betrayed backstabbed he can't believe it Kissinger came with all these promises and the next thing you know he's doing the opposite it is cemented Syria hates the United States the Syrian government hates the United States the Syrian government is going to be pro-soviet and later pro-russian for all eternity because in the mind of the president and then later his son there is no way to work with the United States because we are liars and manipulators the reason why Kissinger did it with Kissinger believed that the way you created security for the United States was you created chaos in the rest of the world your goal was to upend the global system shake it break it make it so there was so much chaos that there that nobody could have a coherent foreign policy and then the United States could operate in that chaos get countries pitted against each other split alliances he split the Egyptian Syrian alliance Egypt was never a real full-fledged ally of the Soviet Union but it was the Soviet Union that armed Egypt it was the Soviet Union that was willing to back up Egypt to step up to when Egypt was in trouble Kissinger wanted to break that too and what he wanted to do is peel Egypt out of this pan Arab secular socialist thing and bring it into the u.s. camp when finally get the peace deal going and then later on the Carter Administration picks it up and runs with it one of the things they promised Egypt is that Egypt will work with Israel it will trade with Israel it will normalize relations with Israel Egypt will never fight Israel again in return whatever the United States is giving Israel an official foreign aid it will give Egypt half of that in foreign aid so to this day Egypt and Israel combined get one-third of the entire US foreign aid package to two countries get one-third Israel gets two two shares for every Egyptian share but the whole thing is based on the role that Israel plays in creating chaos in the Middle East and the role that the United States then doesn't have to play because it it's it's Israel that's doing the cows the reason all of this matters is by 1978 when Saddam Hussein is taking over Iraq and when Ali Abdullah Saleh is taking over Yemen they know they're up against the United States because the United States is doing everything it can to prevent pan-arab secular socialism from taking hold including funding the Muslim Brotherhood including funding communists including funding everything and anything it can including doing bloody civil wars like the civil war in Yemen and so they become pragmatists and that pragmatism means that they're just tyrants right the entire visionless tyrants who aren't actually trying to achieve some greater goal like their tyranny doesn't lead to liberty for their people their tyranny just keeps them in power but then Yemen begins to seriously talk about unification it has a brief civil war that lasts a month in 1986 it's gone wow I love that like why can't we do that like our Civil War took four years and killed 622 thousand people like why can't everybody just have a one-month long civil war it's fantastic Syria is in your eighth of its Civil War like just it's too long the charm wears off I think you know what I mean in the beginning it's so exciting and then by the time you get to year a you just really want it to be taught I still can't believe anybody is still fighting in the Syrian civil war because I know right they're thinking if I surrender I'll be executed dude you're gonna die anyway just get it over with and save everybody's life in the process like Bashar al-assad has won it's over walk away walk over to the hanging gallows and go you you on the wrong side it didn't work out for you that's the way civil wars are it sucks I'm so sorry but but stop stop getting civilians killed just so that you can live a few more days just doesn't make sense to me in any case in 1990 the eastern bloc has fallen apart right 1989 Czechoslovakia East Germany the Berlin wall comes down Hungary Poland the whole thing is crumbled the People's Democratic Republic a Yemen decides it's time for serious talks with Yemen about unification in 1990 they sit down in May 22nd and they sign unification in North and South Yemen merge the Republic of Yemen the Socialist Republic of Yemen and the Communist People's Democratic Republic a.m. and come together and they become the Republican Yemen they moved the capital to soon all the north the capital of North Yemen and Ali Abdullah Saleh becomes the president of Yemen the combined Yemen and then something really strange starts to happen South Yemenis politicians start to get assassinated and then they realize it's a clear pattern somebody is actually going out of their way to look for target and execute South Yemen ease politicians and they you know they don't know who it's probably the CIA working with Ali Abdullah Saleh's government he probably gave them a list and the CIA went did his dirty work but you know how do you prove that or is the where's the documentation so nobody knows exactly but but by 1994 South Yemen had Southie annamund declares its independence in other words the unification between North and South Yemen lasted four freaking years they declare their independence North Yemen goes milk they militarily occupy South Yemen and don't let it break away so from 1994 until 2014 for 20 years Yemen was a single state but only because the North had militarily occupied the south and prevented its breakaway and then the Arab Spring happens in 2000 December 2010 is when the Arab Spring breaks out in Tunisia and it spreads more initially across North Africa the first three states to do the Arab Spring or Tunisia Algeria and Morocco the King of Morocco quickly runs to his people and go what do you want I'll give you the more democracy you want more democracy more Liberty Don the new constitution let's do some amendments to the old constitution wouldn't that be great any hands more power to people the people leave the streets the Arab Spring in Morocco is really quick Algeria the tyrant Buda fleeca comes down Ruta Lee and just starts massacring the people in the streets he goes we are not doing this and they don't this year they they did it again they went into Arab Spring mo this year and the Algerian people toppled bootiful Iike he's out of power so what he did was he managed to extend the length of time he stayed in power for for you know eight years but they eventually got him Tunisia the their tyrant goes down he had been the tyrant of each of Tunisia for 18 years it took him 30 days to bring him down Egypt then the Egyptian population had been watching what happened in Tunisia patiently quietly and when the Tunisian government goes down the Egyptian people go oh my god I think we can do this and on January 25th 2011 Egypt goes into high gear and joins the Arab Spring it takes a gypped 18 days to take out their 30 year long tyranny what they do it they bring down Hosni Mubarak's government when that happens then the whole Arab world thinks oh my god we can do this we can get rid of these monarchies or these tyrants we can get rid of the CIA controlled tyrants who slaughter us in the streets we can do this the Arab Spring spreads to essentially every Arab state the United Arab Emirates just goes here's money here's money please don't no you don't need to processed here didn't you want to buy a silver BMW solid silver not the color silver here here's some Mummy Mummy Mummy and then people leave the streets Bahrain and Kuwait the people are actually quite brutalized nobody's gonna do much instead Arabia but there is a little bit and then of course Syria ends up disintegrating into a civil war Libya ends up the student in grading into a civil war Libya is such a catastrophic failed state it there is now the distinct possibility that Libya will break up that Libya won't exist as a state anymore it'll go the direction of Somalia Somalia is broken up into technically three states but it's it's four because Al Shabaab rules a piece of Somalia also so it's it's basically broken up into four states Syria is eventually going to get put back together the Syrian regime has survived the it's just a matter of time before they clean up right there working on the Italy province it's a catastrophe but it's done Yemen also jumps in to the Arab Spring so Ali Abdullah Saleh is still president of Yemen in 2011 he took he became president of North Yemen in 1978 so how many years is that let's see it was 12 years as president of North Yemen and then it's 22 years as 21 years at the point the Arab Spring arrives as president of the combined Yemen so that's 33 years this guy has been in control of Yemen and it's such a knock-down drag-out fight at one point at one point Ali Abdullah Saleh gets hit in the face with a rocket they find her an RPG at this guy the rocket hits him in the face tears off half of his face they don't have a hospital in Yemen that can that can help him they put him on an airplane they fly him to Saudi Arabia everybody's thinking he's done like if he even survives he's in Saudi Arabia's in the wrong country he can't come back oh my god I think Ben Ali did Ben Ali just died I think he did the dictator of Tunisia just died last week in Saudi Arabia where he's been in exile I think I got that right I could have misheard the news but I think last week he died so anyway Abdullah Saleh is in Saudi Arabia they put his face back on but obviously it's not quite right and he flies back to Yemen who is this person he can't help but admire it right he's now been a dictator of Yemen for 34 years his face was torn off he flies back to Yemenis I'm still here I'm not going anywhere hold on keeps slipping they didn't quite get it attached where's the superglue and you need it he goes down though that year like he he he gets him back to Yemen he's still in the trenches fighting he's got this thing he doesn't it falls apart his government does collapse and a new democratic government replaces it they hold elections everybody's thinking Oh Yemen might make it like Tunisia made it by 2012 it each IFFT is gonna have democratic elections it looks like Egypt may have made it they elect Morsi and then it becomes apparent Egypt didn't make it there because the Egyptian people didn't vote for a very good candidate and then there's a year after Morsi 365 days after Morsi is inaugurated he's taken out in another revolution and he's replaced by CC because again Egyptians suck at voting they're like Americans really terrible at voting we should unify just have the same bad leaders together make life better anyway and then CC of course is Donald Trump's favorite dictator CC showed up at the g7 to give a speech and Donald Trump got up and said where's my favorite dictator and then he said oh I know Sisi isn't the best guy but you know things are so hard in Egypt he has to be kind of tough it's like maybe you don't have favorite dictators I'm just throwing on out there but maybe if you were aspiring right you could look at role models - to imitate see season the worst he's not he's just not the worst I mean he's done he's done some bad things but who hasn't like maybe Modi or President Xi the concentration camps in China and India anyway I remember 25 years ago having so much hope the world is gone exactly the wrong direction pretty much every vector so this new brand Newton Yemenis democracy is going it's plugging along but it's weak it's fragile all outside observers are going oh my god I don't know if this thing's gonna make it 2014 the Houthi revolution begins the the majority of Yemenis Russia the Houthis represent this year and by the majority EMA knees are Shia I'm not sure the exact number but it's probably like three-quarters Shia one quarter Sunday so it's not even close the XI outnumber the sunny by a very significant margin somewhere around three to one the Houthis as the representative this year attack North Yemen that's where the the Shia are they're mostly in North Yemen and they capture Solana the capital of Yemen almost instantaneously like one of the first things that falls and before you know it they've captured almost all of North Yemen what used to be North Yemen the government then grabs whatever military assets it has left and it retreats to South Yemen and creates a temporary capital in iya Dhin Dhin is the cap of the capital of the former People's Democratic Republic in Yemen so the irony of ironies is that in the opening moves of the of the Houthi uprising the Houthis end up in control of North Yemen and the government that is the descendent government of Abdullah Saleh and Arab Spring ends up in exile in AD in the capital of South Yemen Saudi Arabia the United States in Israel back the guys in the south and added the UAE is backing a faction in the south as well but it's a different faction so that's the coalition so if you hear Americans talk about or the military talk about the coalition it's Saudi Arabia it's it's the government in the South that used to be in the north it's Saudi Arabia United States the UAE those are those guys the they also have ironically enough as allies co-belligerent not allies sorry I misspoke they have as Co belligerence because if the coalition isn't made up of allies officially right just for the record Saudi Arabia is not a US ally we have no alliance treaty with them they are our friend they are our partner but there's no official alliance between us Israel the United States don't have an official alliance Israel is not officially an ally of the United States they are our friend they are our partner but there's no alliance don't call them allies it's incorrect I misspoke earlier when I said this Co belligerence just like Finland was with Germany in World War 2 Finland was very clear that they were not a German Ally they just had a common enemy the Soviet Union right just for the record having said that ISIL you know the guys we hate so much in Syria in Iraq are also fighting along with fought alongside the government that's in exile in the south against the Houthis and so is al-qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula so the guys that we been hunting for how many years now those guys are actually on our side in the Yemen's Civil War just for the record would reason that's so incredibly ironic is we're fighting those very same forces in Syria and Iraq so in Iraq where we've been fighting ISIL we've been allied with Iran against ISIL in Yemen where were fighting the Houthis we've been allied with ISIL against the Iranian backed Houthis that's just kissinger's policy of chaos make a completely incoherent world where everything's chaos in one more you're on the same side in the next war you're fighting each other and and and just make it so it's impossible for anybody to have a coherent foreign policy but the United States that's the goal so chaos kill Arabs create genocide Arabs are six percent of the world's population United States is four and a half percent just perspective and Arabs are fifty percent of the world's refugees we are currently in the world's worst ever refugee crisis this is worse than what happened after World War two Turkey is the largest refugee host country on Earth it has four million refugees Germany got to a million and Angela Merkel's government almost toppled Turkey has four million turkeys a third-world country Germany is one of the richest countries on earth Germany had a hard time handling a million refugees you can't you can imagine what a a third-world country is doing with four million refugees this is madness the world we live in and of course most of them are from Iraq and Syria because we destroyed Iraq and there there when the Arab Spring happened in Syrian it devolved into a civil war a lot of the Iraqis who had fled Iraq to Syria joined in and the many of them became ISIL members and the next thing you know we basically caused the chaos in Iraq to spread to Syria and we collapsed them and we created a refugee crisis that now Turkey has to manage no wow anyway one-third of Yemen's population now after five years of civil war one-third 10,000,000 people are food insecure what that means is as things currently stand it's just a matter of time before those 10 million people begin to starve to death mass starvation is coming it's it's a done deal its eminent there's no way to stop it except to stop the Civil War UN food transfer UN attempts to bring in food are constantly disrupted because there is a civil war going on and one side will capture a port another side of blockade a port the saudi-led coalition the coalition has indiscriminately bombed the living hell out of Yemen Gotham one of our allies is on the side of the Houthis so it's North Korea Iran gutta and Syria on the side of the Houthis against the coalition partners it's one of the reasons why Saudi Arabia last year blockaded and got on right they was it last year or 2017 I've lost track ever since Trump got elected everything blurs together feels like I'm in constant constant chaos and I can't have a coherent policy anyway wait a minute his Trump Kissinger maybe he read his book Kissinger admits this this isn't like a secret this is Kissinger said this is the Kissinger doctrine so chaos everywhere make the world crazy and then you can be the same person in the midst of the madness so Yemen is in this crisis where it's being bombed in the civil war where the Houthis control 80% of the population the the government-in-exile controls 20% of population there's no chance for the government in exile to get back into power at this point so we've been fighting the civil war we've been on the wrong side of civil war helping commit war crimes against the Yemenis population the eminates population is on the verge of starvation all for five years it's cost millions of dollars thousands of lives hundreds of thousands of lives for nothing right at this point but here's the really ironic twist last month I think it was I think it was August I'm gonna go with August what the coalition broke up just a little bit the UAE has been backing a faction of Yemenis of the Yemenis coalition the for the government in exile what they are is their South Yemenis independence fighters their goal is to break up Yemen and have a independent South Yemen and then jettison North Yemen their goal has been that since 1994 it's just they realized about 2015-2016 as the civil war was unfolding that this might be their opportunity the UAE backed independence fighters for South Yemen just captured ad in the capital in the south so now the coalition government in exile has no functioning capital to operate out of because the Coalition is now split with the UAE and the pro-independence guys owning owning the capital in the south so the so the coalition is is beginning to crumble there's just no two ways about it so again we've picked the wrong side in a conflict and it's created turtle madness I was being signaled so I got distracted in any case that's where we are that's where we are today so there's this civil war that's unlike the previous one because it's unclear how gets resolved right the previous in the war the 1962 to 70 civil war got resolved by a referendum but how do you do a referendum like this the result is a done deal do you keep Yemen together or do you go ahead and let it break up if you keep coming together the Houthis win the referendum they're 80 percent of population if you break up Yemen leave these win the referendum because they're 99 percent of North Yemen you know I mean like there's this is a done deal the question is are we the Saudis the Israelis the other members of the coalition willing to go okay we accept defeat like the coalition was willing to do in 1970 when people realize this make no sense anyway I'm gonna stop it there and open up for questions you have to ask questions or else I won't let you leave and like we it's gonna suck okay so the question is is there a current capital yeah I saw not as the capital the Houthis have that is the that was the official capital of the unified Yemen as of 1990 the coalition backed government that had to flee the capital when the capital was captured by the Houthis in 2014 fled died then which was the capital of South Yemen with South Yemen was independent what happened was the UAE UAE backed separatists South Yemeni separatists captured that capital I believe it was last month it might have been July and as a result now the coalition backed government is ungrounded hold on just a second I know this is rude because I'm in the middle of this livestream and you'll hear me talk but just a second alright one more question and I'll let you go I remember there was a mood button not mute moot this is irrelevant alright one more no even that was funny I tried yes oh so the question is if I've heard anything about rumors of al-qaeda or ISIL is that using Yemen to ship weapons to South America so I haven't heard anything about that I mean it wouldn't surprise me by any means but it's still a pretty long journey to go around Africa so are they going through Africa then like through Somalia I mean there are definitely paths from Somalia and be a little bit tricky to get through Ethiopia but once you got to Central African Republic or South Sudan South Sudan's in the Civil War it's in crisis if you get through there chad has some instability and then you get to Nigeria where Boko Haram is running amok I mean it's totally plausible I'm not sure if you if they're gonna if you've got the weapons to South America I don't know what you'd deal with them it seems to me like it'd be better just to link up the Sahel region which is where the Sahara meets sub-saharan Africa into one big jihad and fight like that I mean there was an attempt to do that at one point that's what happened to Mali right Molly got captured by Salafist Islamists and then in a really strange move France decided no this isn't gonna happen and they invaded Mali and put down the Salafist Islamists and I'm still baffled that France cared enough about its former colony that it actually did something but anyway so yes I can't I can I can't confirm or deny but that's because I have no knowledge it's not because I'm hiding something as opposed to like a politician would say I can't confirm or deny because they're hiding something yeah so that's a great question so the question is is there any hope um and it'll be stable in 25 years so there's a lot of reason to have no hope and the reason I'm saying that is the world is trending in a direction where there are more more failed states Democratic Republic of Congo Somalia Libya now Afghanistan there are these states that can't be put back together the once the state apparatus collapses it doesn't have the wealth the infrastructure or the inclination to rebuild the state apparatus and as a result can't control its own territory so that's on the one hand on the other hand there are states that are relatively stable that have lost control over territory for example Vietnam and the Philippines have both descended into this sort of gang controlled system Mexico has descended into this gang controlled system and so we've got what used to be relatively stable States that are losing territorial integrity to gangs and then we have states that are just outright collapsing and that seems to be the trend more and more states seem to be heading that direction not fewer and fewer states I I mean I can imagine a future where the United States does this because we're just so angry at each other and hate each other's guts so much and so unwilling to face the truth on a daily basis that I right but those are the ingredients that will lead to civil war you don't want to be here this is not good the last time we were this divided it was 1860 so you know that makes me not happy that makes me think that this is unresolvable having said that I think it's entirely possible that the United States Saudi Arabia the coalition partners will simply lose the will to fight it's too expensive it's cost too many lives it's bad like relations it makes United States look not good and if that happens it's entirely possible that the Houthis will then simply take over Yemen maybe Yemen will split if Yemen splits or the Houthis simply managed to take over I could totally see that leading to stability having said that there is Syria Syria has except for the inland province put itself back together Syria has recovered from the Civil War Bashar al-assad is a tyrant plain pure and simple you know like he's not probably somebody you you're hoping will rule your country but he's ending the civil war and he's restoring order so that gives me hope right it's tyranny it's nasty he's done really ugly things but then you know compared to having the Hobbesian nightmare of no civil society maybe it's better to be ruled by a by a tyrant I mean I'm at that I'm at that point where I'm starting to think you know my old ideals of people can rule themselves rationally and intelligently that's going away it's also possible that I have vicarious trauma from reading all this stuff all the time because one of the symptoms of vicarious trauma you're irritable you're angry you're a little paranoid and you see the world in a negative light all the time and constantly studying this stuff I think has a toll what's really interesting is academia is now finally starting to admit that this is the truth and there's actually now a little bit of a conversation amongst academics because you know like as an academic I'm inclined to put down any trauma that I'm experiencing from studying this stuff and say oh I'm not experiencing it I must be some kind of ivory tower weenie for feeling so bad but it turns out that psychologically watching trauma reading about trauma or seeing trauma and photos actually triggers the same places in your brain that experiencing the trauma does too by the way playing the video games does this too if you play these first-person shooters on a regular base you will end up with PTSD and your your mind can't differentiate this from from reality just for the record so just note that you know like if you find it hard to get into the Guardian and read it every day and you're a little worn out there's a reason it's the this is constantly being bombarded with negative news will take a toll on you so I'm saying all that to say that I might be incapable of being fully objective and maybe there is more hope than I think there is one of the things we do know is that climate change you know I had to bring this in that climate change is destabilizing the planet it was a major contributing factor in the Syrian civil war it is undoubtedly going to be a major factor in Yemen because Yemen is one of the super vulnerable places one of the reasons for that is Yemen is pretty hot now it's mountainous - so once you get up in elevation it cools down dramatically but most of the arable land is really hot photosynthesis stops at 140 degrees Fahrenheit so if you're already at 125 it doesn't take a wild imagination to realize that at some point Yemen is going to be in trouble especially when you consider that right Yemen Yemen used to be one of the major world's major coffee producers there's a province in Yemen called mocha Yemen is where the Arabica bean was from and in a few years coffee won't they can't they won't be able to grow it in Yemen so the original the the coffee bean was originally from Ethiopia what happened was Yemenis traders went to Ethiopia found it brought it to Yemm and it grew greatly I mean he's climate and then they marketed it from Yemen and so the irony of ironies is the place where we think of its coffee might not be able to grow in mocha like that's wrong but it seems to be a very likely future I don't say certain because I want you guys to have hope so you'll go fight save yourselves might children but it's it's great so so the answer is I can see you said I or Yemen stabilizes I think part of that is you putting pressure on your government to get us out of the coalition because the Coalition is on the wrong side not that the Houthis are great it's just what's what is our side it's not like our side is standing for First Amendment rights or something or our thoughts and that side is standing for freedom of religion or our side is trying to end some kind of genocide we're just fighting because it's we don't want the Iranian side to win well that's not a thing and so that's part of it a major part of it would be you putting pressure on your government now you'd have to have a responsive government for that to work right a government that actually cared what the public thought but one way you can make a government that even doesn't like you that has contempt for you cares to protest like Egypt is doing again Egypt is now in day three of another round of protests so think about it eighteen eighty nineteen ninety nineteen fifty two two thousand eleven two thousand thirteen and now looks like 2019 at six that's six of revolutions in a hundred and what is that thirty nine years that's intense yeah does anybody have Tylenol or ibuprofen does anybody have another question or are we done we can be done there's no I'm not no more arm twisting okay thanks thanks for the questions [Applause] you\""

       "AIMessage(content=\"**Summary:**\\n\\nThe talk is about the history of Yemen and its connection to the broader Middle East, particularly the rise of pan-Arab secular socialism and the subsequent conflicts that have shaped the region. The speaker discusses how the 1919 Egyptian revolution, which was inspired by pan-Arab secular socialism, had a significant impact on the Middle East, leading to the creation of various ideologies and political systems. The talk also explores how the United States and other Western powers have intervened in the region, often with disastrous consequences, and how these interventions have contributed to the current crisis in Yemen.\\n\\n**Key Points:**\\n\\n1. **The 1919 Egyptian Revolution:** The revolution was a significant event in the Middle East, inspiring pan-Arab secular socialism and shaping the region's politics. The revolution's ideology emphasized unity, secularism, and socialism, and it had a lasting impact on the region.\\n\\n2. **The Rise of Pan-Arab Secular Socialism:** Pan-Arab secular socialism became a dominant ideology in Egypt and other Arab states, but it faced challenges from other ideologies, including the Muslim Brotherhood and the Faloona. The Faloona were a group of Egyptians who believed in capitalism and the importance of individualism.\\n\\n3. **The United States' Intervention in the Middle East:** The United States has a long history of intervening in the Middle East, often with disastrous consequences. The country has funded various groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood and the Communists, in an effort to undermine pan-Arab secular socialism.\\n\\n4. **The Yemeni Civil War:** The Yemeni civil war, which began in 1962, was a significant conflict that pitted the pan-Arab secular socialist government against the monarchists. The war was fueled by external interventions, including the support of the United States, Israel, and Saudi Arabia.\\n\\n5. **The Current Crisis in Yemen:** The current crisis in Yemen is a result of the ongoing civil war, which has been exacerbated by the Saudi-led coalition's bombing campaign. The crisis has led to widespread suffering, including food insecurity and mass starvation.\\n\\n6. **The Importance of Climate Change:** Climate change is a significant factor in the crisis in Yemen, as the country is vulnerable to drought and other environmental challenges. The speaker notes that climate change will likely have a devastating impact on Yemen's ability to grow coffee and other crops.\\n\\n7. **The Need for Pressure on Governments:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of putting pressure on governments to end their involvement in the conflict in Yemen. The speaker notes that a responsive government is necessary for this to happen, and that citizens must demand change.\\n\\n8. **The Impact of Vicarious Trauma:** The speaker discusses the impact of vicarious trauma on academics and others who study the Middle East. The speaker notes that watching or reading about trauma can trigger the same places in the brain as experiencing trauma, and that this can have a negative impact on mental health.\\n\\n9. **The Possibility of Hope:** Despite the dire situation in Yemen, the speaker notes that there is still hope for a resolution. The speaker suggests that pressure on governments, combined with a responsive government, could lead to a more stable future for Yemen.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 643, 'prompt_tokens': 12952, 'total_tokens': 13595, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}, 'model_name': 'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-3bf383d3-b0df-4f3f-90d3-b3f5ba42a691-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12952, 'output_tokens': 643, 'total_tokens': 13595, 'input_token_details': {}, 'output_token_details': {}})"
